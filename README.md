# Core Microservices

## Overview

Core Microservices provides a set of essential services to support startup applications 
by offering modular and scalable services, to help companies save time and resources, allowing them to focus on their unique business logic.

It provides a growing set of ready-to-use backend services and frontend modules that allow startups, small teams, and solo developers to launch production-quality systems without reinventing the architecture.


## What is the goal?

Modern applications require:
Authentication & authorization
Document management
Event-driven communication
Monitoring, observability, logging
Frontend integration
Scalability from day one

## What’s included?
The project will include services like:

- User Management - managing users, roles, and permissions.
- Communication service - sending emails, SMS, and push notifications.
- Document Management Service - managing documents, files, and attachments.
- Localization Service - managing translations for multiple languages.
- Template Service - managing email templates, SMS templates, and document templates in HTML format.
- Form Service - managing questionnaires, surveys, and forms.
- Payment Service - managing payments, invoices, and subscriptions.
- Analytics Service - managing analytics, reports, and dashboards.

More services will be added in the future to provide a complete set of services for a startup application.
You can choose what services you need and integrate them into your application with further customization.
